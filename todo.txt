## Tests

1. add intellisense comments

somewhat done.
1. Fix namespace issue with global usings.


1. CRUD with identity tables v0

    Identity Insert,
    Normal Insert
    Read
    Update
    Delete

Chinook Customer ok

2. CRUD tests Normal tables v0
    Normal Insert
    Read
    Update
    Delete

3. Transaction normal
4. Transaction with Error, to see it is rolled back

5. Paging tests

6. Write oracle, chinook test for auto increment and normal

    fork and give a pull request, need to sign my commits. Do it later
    https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-xe/blob/main/examples/dkr-create-oracle-xe-server

7. column --> expected .net type
Need to create my own example database for these examples.



## Bugs

## Improvements and Nice to Have

1. Use quotes in queries as configuration.
This may be necessary for Oracle

2. add [JsonPropertyName("XXX")] to code generation

JsonNamingPolicy includes new naming policies for snake_case (with an underscore) 

3. add foreign key code generations
According to foreign keys, detail tables method will be added
config.json property will manage it.


4. Add config.json following code generation options
- add global usings to interface
- add new namespace syntax to interface



5. 

GetRows
GetOneValue
GetOneRow --> (first or default)

For GetOneRow, need to add top, limit statements to the query.
Not added yet.

6. Refactoring methods to English Only Names

7. Add configuration method which initializes from configuration files (app.config ...)

8. Read logging and fix it

9. Later check multiple .net SDK versions
For now, we work with .net6
    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file


10. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file
think about multiple version support

11. change logging
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-7.0

## Documentation and Examples

1. give examples for dependency injection

2. use mermaid as markdown to create some diagrams
I have started doing it.
I need to improve documentation.
https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/


## Code Review

1. Nullable compile warnings
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/nullable-warnings


2. Karkas.Core.Data vs Karkas.Core.DataUtil ???
Should I fix the namespace?

3. Check why we have references to following dlls

- Microsoft.Identity.Client.*

4. CommandLineParser is good one.
