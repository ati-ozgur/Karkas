# todo



## First to look

1. For oracle, force decimal to int,long
oracle code generation number to long
10,0
38,0

2. dal.QueryUsingColumnName(Album.ColumnNames.AlbumId,)

Here, it should other where operators.


2. CLOB,BLOB does not work

3. 

4. to dict, from dict
- Nullable DONE
- Put to config? think about it


5. docker SQL error checking

ERROR at line 7:


3. Refactoring methods to English Only Names


2. add intellisense comments
docfx is decided and v0 is added.

- need to improve comments
- need to add github pages
- ???need to filter protected, abstract classes


3. Master Detail Queries


4. Read records for generating record struct?



6. validate method

7. pydantic methods look.

8. Entity Framework methods



## Tests

1. Create looping script which will check following configurations

- UseSchemaNameInNamespaces
- UseSchemaNameInSqlQueries
- UseSchemaNameInFolders    
- UseQuotesInQueries
- UseGlobalUsings
- UseFileScopedNamespace


2. Paging tests


3. column --> expected .net type
Need to create my own example database for these examples.

4. create dotnet/nuget packages
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-the-dotnet-cli

github secrets and other should be looked.
PackageId and version how to automate??

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageId>Karkas.DataUtil.2024.09.22</PackageId>
    <Version>2024.09.22</Version>
    <Authors>Atilla Özgür</Authors>
    <Company>Karkas</Company>
  </PropertyGroup>



## Bugs

## Improvements and Nice to Have


1. add [JsonPropertyName("XXX")] to code generation

JsonNamingPolicy includes new naming policies for snake_case (with an underscore) 


2. Add configuration method which initializes from configuration files (app.config ...)

3. Read logging and fix it

4. Later check multiple .net SDK versions
For now, we work with .net6
    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file


5. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file
think about multiple version support

6. change logging
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-7.0



## Documentation and Examples

1. give examples for dependency injection

2. use mermaid as markdown to create some diagrams
I have started doing it.
I need to improve documentation.
https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/


## Code Review

1. Nullable compile warnings
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/nullable-warnings


2. Karkas.Data vs Karkas.DataUtil ???
Should I fix the namespace?


4. CommandLineParser is good one.
https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline
https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline/wiki/Getting-Started
https://medium.com/@eduardosilva_94960/mastering-command-line-parsing-in-net-core-with-commandlineparser-c20721100359

## Later

Dockerfile enhancements

fork and give a pull request, need to sign my commits. Do it later
https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-xe/blob/main/examples/dkr-create-oracle-xe-server



## Decisions

1. Due to Oracle, I updated QueryHelper
It generates quoted string now.
Should I make this one customizable so that it could be turned off and on.
